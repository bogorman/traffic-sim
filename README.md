## Features

The application uses the [sbt-play-scalajs](https://github.com/vmunier/sbt-play-scalajs) sbt plugin and the [play-scalajs-scripts](https://github.com/vmunier/play-scalajs-scripts) library.

- Run your application like a regular Play app using activator (https://www.lightbend.com/activator/download):
  - `compile` simply triggers the Scala.js compilation
  - `run` triggers the Scala.js fastOptJS command on page refresh
  - `~compile`, `~run`, continuous compilation is also available
  - `start`, `stage` and `dist` generate the optimised javascript
  - [`playscalajs.html.scripts`](https://github.com/vmunier/play-with-scalajs-example/blob/c5fa9ce35954278bea903823a7f0528b1d68b5db/server/app/views/main.scala.html#L14) selects the optimised javascript file when the application runs in prod mode (`start`, `stage`, `dist`).
- Source maps
  - Open your browser dev tool to set breakpoints or to see the guilty line of code when an exception is thrown
  - Source Maps is _disabled in production_ by default to prevent your users from seeing the source files. But it can easily be enabled in production too by setting `emitSourceMaps in fullOptJS := true` in the Scala.js projects.
